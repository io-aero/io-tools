# IO-TEMPLATE - Release Schedule

To create a new release, the following steps must be performed in the specified order.
It is not allowed to continue with the next step until the current step has been completed successfully, i.e. also without any errors. 

### **1. Manual quality control**.

#### a) Remove all personal markers.

It is good practice to mark experimental source code, such as source code comments or logging messages that are only used for testing, with a uniform personal marker, such as **`lho`** or **`wwe`**, so that this source code can be easily discovered and removed for release builds.

#### b) Check all **`TODO`** markers for necessity.

#### c) Check all links in the **`docs`** file directory.

Links should generally contain the following suffix: **`{:target="_blank"}`**. 
This ensures that a web page activated by the link is opened in a new tab.

#### d) Unnecessary annotations **`@pytest.mark.issue`** in the file directory **`tests`**.

This annotation can be used to run individual tests selectively. 
To remove the remains of it one can use the regular expression **`^@pytest.mark.issue`**.

### **2. Define a new version number**.

The rules of semantic versioning must be applied. 
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
* PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

See [here](https://semver.org/){:target="_blank"} for details.

#### a) Update the version number in the **IO-TEMPLATE** files:

- pyproject.toml
- docs/development_environment.md
- docs/library_installation.md
- docs/release_history.md
- docs/release_notes.md
- src//io_glob.py

#### b) Update the project in io-docker and io-docker-shared.

- Check the versions of the software to be installed and adjust them if necessary.
- Create the Docker image that matches the new version.

#### c) Copy the **IO-TEMPLATE** specific project `9.9.9` from io-docker to `io-template/scripts/9.9.9`.

### **3. Create release candidate branch `<rel_branch>`**.

### **4. Check the functionality of **IO-TEMPLATE** in the docker container and in the VM**. 

#### a) Create the Docker image in the **IO-TEMPLATE** repository.

#### b) Manually test the functionality of **IO-TEMPLATE** in the Docker container.

#### c) Create a clean virtual machine (VM) with the scripts.

#### d) Start the VM and clone the **IO-TEMPLATE** repository.

    git clone https://github.com/io-aero/io-template

### **5. Switch to the release candidate branch `<rel_branch> `**.

    git checkout <rel_branch>

### **6. Finalise the new release**.

#### a. Execute the following command in the **IO-TEMPLATE** clone.

    make final

#### b. Create the final pull request.

#### c. Create the new release in GitHub:

- Releases --> Create a new release
- Choose a tag ---> **`9.9.9`** ---> + Create a new tag
- Release title ---> **`Release 9.9.9: <headline>`**.
- Describe the release ---> **`see: https://github.com/io-aero/io-template/blob/main/docs/release_notes.md`**
- **`x`** This is a pre-release
- **`x`** Create a discussion for this release
- Publish release

### **7. Preepare the next release**.

#### a. Choose a new preliminary version number.

#### b. Prepare the following files in the **io-template** repository for the new version:

- pyproject.toml
- docs/development_environment.md
- docs/library_installation.md
- docs/release_history.md
- docs/release_notes.md
- src//io_glob.py

#### c. Prepare **io-template** project in the repositories **io-docker** und **io-docker-shared** for the new version:
